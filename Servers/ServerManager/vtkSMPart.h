// .NAME vtkSMPart - PVDatas are now composed of multiple parts.
// .SECTION Description
// This object manages one vtk data set and all the vtk objects
// necessary to render the data set.
// The class has no user iterface.
// For now:  It is a PV object and resides only on process 0.
// Since it has no user interface, it we might want it on all process.

  // Description:
  // Set the id for the vtk data object.  This should be the primary
  // method of manipulating the data since it exists on all processes.
  // This is for setting up the links between VTK objects and PV
  // object.  This call also sets the input to the mapper.
  // SetVTKDataTclName should be called after the application has been
  // set, but befor PVData is used as input a filter or output of a
  // source.  We could change the object so that it creates its own
  // data (during initia but then we would have to tell it what type
  // of data to create.

  // Description:
  // This method is called on creation.  If the data object is unstructured and 
  // has a maximum number of pieces, then a extract piece filter is inserted
  // before the data object.  This will give parallel pipelines at the
  // expense of initial generation (reading) of the data.
