// .NAME vtkSMUndoStack
// .SECTION Description
// This is the undo/redo stack for the Server Manager. This provides a 
// unified face for undo/redo irrespective of number of connections, their
// type etc etc.
// 
// The class records Server Manager changes that are undo/redo able and
// collects them. To begin recording such changes one must call BeginUndoSet().
// To end recording use EndUndoSet(). On EndUndoSet, the changes are collected
// into an XML which is then sent to the data server of the connection
// set when BeginUndoSet() is called. For this to work properly the GUI
// must ensure that between BeginUndoSet() and EndUndoSet() changes are
// only performed to the proxies with the connection id used to BeginUndoSet().
// In other words, a undo-able unit can only be on the same connection. 
// 
// On every undo/redo, it fetches the XML state change from the server.
// vtkSMUndoRedoStateLoader is used to generate a vtkUndoSet object from
// the XML. GUI can subclass vtkSMUndoRedoStateLoader to handle GUI specific
// XML elements. The loader instance must be set before performing the undo,
// otherwise vtkSMUndoRedoStateLoader is used.
//
// This class also provides API to push any vtkUndoSet instance on to a 
// server. GUI can use this to push its own changes that is undoable across
// connections.
// 
// .SECTION TODO
// \li Compound proxies are not handled yet.
// \li Mutiple clients are not supported. For now, the server can connect to only
// one client.

  // Begin monitoring the proxy manager for undoable operations.
  // All such operations are noted by creating UndoElements for each.
  // All the undo elements will be part of a vtkUndoSet with the given

  // that separate undo sets are created for operations on different connections.

  // that something has been pushed on the server side undo stack.
  // As a consequence each client will update their undo stack status. Note,
  // only the status is updated, the actual undo state is not sent to the client
  // until it requests it. Ofcourse, this part is still not implemnted. For now,
  // multiple clients are not supported.
