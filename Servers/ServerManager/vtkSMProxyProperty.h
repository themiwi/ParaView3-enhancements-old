// .NAME vtkSMProxyProperty - property representing pointer(s) to vtkObject(s)
// .SECTION Description
// vtkSMProxyProperty is a concrete sub-class of vtkSMProperty representing
// pointer(s) to vtkObject(s) (through vtkSMProxy). If 
// UpdateSelf is true, the proxy ids (as opposed to the server object ids)
// are passed to the stream. 
// Note: This property connects two proxies: proxy A (to which this property
// belongs) and proxy B (or more) (which is to be proxy A by using this 
// property).
// The way this is set depends on the number of IDs of the two proxies.
// If A and B have same number of IDs, the vtkObject represented by i'th ID on
// B is set on the server object represented by i'th ID on A. If A has 1 ID and
// B has more than one, than all IDs in B are set on A one after the other. 
// If B has 1 ID and A has more than one, than vtkObject represented by B is 
// set on all the server objects of A.
// 
// ProxyProperty supports attribute "remove_command". Note that if RemoveCommand 
// is set,  the clean_command is ignored. When RemoveCommand is set, only the 
// changes in the proxies (by AddProxy/RemoveProxy) are progaated to servers 
// .ie. those proxies not 
// present in the previous call to AppendCommandToStream are set on the 
// servers using this->Command
// and those missing during current call are removed from the servers using 
// this->RemoveCommand. Note that a property with "RemoveCommand" set should 
// not be shared among more than 1 proxies.

  // Description:
  // Add a proxy to the list of proxies without calling Modified
  // (if modify is false). This is commonly used when ImmediateUpdate
  // is true but it is more efficient to avoid calling Update until
  // the last proxy is added. To do this, add all proxies with modify=false
  // and call Modified after the last.
  // This will perform domain checking. If the domain check fails,
  // the proxy will not be added and 0 will be returned.
  // Returns 1 on success. If the domain check fails or the property
  // is read only, returns 0.
  // All proxies added with AddProxy() will become "consumers" of
  // the proxy passed to AppendCommandToStream().
