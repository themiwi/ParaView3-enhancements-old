// .NAME vtkSMServerSideAnimationPlayer
// .SECTION Description
// This is an example of a server side connection cleaner. Connection cleaners
// are typically used on the server side to perform certain operations
// when a connection closes. This cleaner requires that the server-side
// server manager has been revived before the connection was terminated.
// It uses this revived server manager and render any render modules
// that may be present, and play any animation scenes that were
// present in the server manager.
