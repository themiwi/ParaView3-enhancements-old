// .NAME vtkSMMultiViewFactory - factor for multiple views.
// .SECTION Description
// vtkSMMultiViewFactory must be used to create render views in a multiview
// system. This makes it possible to share the view objects on the server side.
// One can still create individual render view views, however, they won't be
// sharing their server side render window.

  // Description:
  // Don't use these methods directly,
  // Whenever NewRenderView() is called, the newly created render view 
  // is added to the "RenderViews" property of this proxy. The property
  // leads to a call to these methods to add/remove the proxy which gets 
  // added/removed as a subproxy. We have a property for the render views 
  // so that the operation is undo/redo able.
