// .NAME vtkPVArrayInformation - Data array information like type.
// .SECTION Description
// This objects is for eliminating direct access to vtkDataObjects
// by the "client".  Only vtkPVPart and vtkPVProcessModule should access
// the data directly.  At the moment, this object is only a container
// and has no useful methods for operating on data.
// Note:  I could just use vtkDataArray objects and store the range
// as values in the array.  This would eliminate this object.
