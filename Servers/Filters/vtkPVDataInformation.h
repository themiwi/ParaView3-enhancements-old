// .NAME vtkPVDataInformation - Light object for holding data information.
// .SECTION Description
// This object is a light weight object. It has no user interface and
// does not necessarily last a long time.  It is meant to help
// collect information about data object and collections of data objects.
// It has a PV in the class name because it should never be moved into
// VTK.

// Note:  It would be nice to use a vtkDataSet object to store all of this
// information.  It already has the structure.  I do not know how I would
// store the information (number of points, bounds ...) with out storing
// the actual points and cells.
