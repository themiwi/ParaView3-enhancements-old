// .NAME vtkProcessModuleConnectionManager
// .SECTION Description
// This is a manager of the simultaneous connections in ProcessModule.
// The first connection in the Manager is always the "Self" connection.
// This is the connection used to communicate with all the MPI processes
// of this node. All other connections (if any), are client-server connections
// using sockets. SendStream() on ConnectionManager ensures that the stream
// is sent to the right connection. 
// ConnectionManager also provides mechanism to monitor all the client-server
// connections in the collection for activity simultaneously.
// 
// ConnectionManager can be configured to accept connections. In this case,
// it sets up a server socket (vtkServerSocket) at the given port. As and when 
// new connections arrive on this socket, a new connection object 
// (vtkProcessModuleConnection) is created and validated. Once validated,
// it gets added to the internal collection of connections.
//
// ConnectionManager can be simply told to open a connection with a remote host
// socket. In that case, it set up a socket (vtkClientSocket) and attempts to connect 
// the given host, If successfully connected and authenticated, it will
// add the connection to the internal store.
