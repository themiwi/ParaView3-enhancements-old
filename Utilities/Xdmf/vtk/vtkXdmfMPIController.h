// .NAME vtkXdmfMPIController - Process communication using MPI
// .SECTION Description
// vtkXdmfMPIController is a concrete class which implements the
// abstract multi-process control methods defined in vtkMultiProcessController
// using MPI (Message Passing Interface) 
// cf. Using MPI / Portable Parallel Programming with the Message-Passing
// Interface, Gropp et al, MIT Press.
// It also provide functionality specific to MPI and not present in 
// vtkMultiProcessController.
// Before any MPI communication can occur Initialize() must be called
// by all processes. It is required to be called once, controllers
// created after this need not call Initialize().
// At the end of the program Finalize() must be called by all
// processes. 
// The use of user-defined communicators are supported with 
// vtkMPICommunicator and vtkMPIGroup. Note that a duplicate of
// the user defined communicator is used for internal communications (RMIs).
// This communicator has the same properties as the user one except that
// it has a new context which prevents the two communicators from
// interfering with each other.
