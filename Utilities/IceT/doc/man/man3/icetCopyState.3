.TH icetCopyState 3 "June 12, 2003" "Sandia National Labs" "ICE-T Reference"
.SH NAME
.B icetCopyState
\- copy state machine of one context to another.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <GL/ice-t.h>
.sp
.BI "void icetCopyState(IceTContext " dest ", const IceTContext " src ");"
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B icetCopyState
function replaces the state of
.I dest
with the current state of
.IR src .
This function can be used to quickly duplicate a context.
.PP
The
.B IceTCommunicator
object associated with
.I dest
is
.I not
changed (nor can it ever be).  Consequently, the state values of
.BR ICET_RANK " and " ICET_NUM_PROCESSORS
are not copied either, since they are directly tied to the
.B IceTCommunicator
object.  However, every other state parameter is copied.
.SH ERRORS
None.
.SH WARNINGS
None.
.SH BUGS
The state is copied blindly.  It is therefore possible to copy states that
are invalid for a context's communicator.  For example, a display rank may
not refer to a valid process id.
.SH NOTES
Behavior is undefined if
.IR dest " or " src
has never been created or has already been destroyed.
