.SH Description

.PP
\fBIceT \fPrequires a communicator in order to perform correctly. An 
application is free to build its own communicator, but many will simply 
prefer to use MPI, which is a well established parallel communication 
tool. Thus, \fBIceT \fPcomes with an implementation of 
\fBIceTCommunicator\fP
that uses the MPI communication layer 
underneath. 
.PP
\fBicetCreateMPICommunicator\fP
is used to create an 
\fBIceTCommunicator\fP
that uses the \fImpi_comm\fP
MPI communication 
object. The resulting \fBIceTCommunicator\fP
shares the same process 
group and process rank as the original \fBMPI_Comm\fP
communicator. 
.PP
\fImpi_comm\fP
is duplicated, which has two consiquences. First, all 
process in \fImpi_comm\fP\&'s
group may need to call 
\fBicetCreateMPICommunicator\fP
in order for any of them to proceed 
(depending on the MPI implementation). Second, \fImpi_comm\fP
and the 
resulting \fBIceTCommunicator\fP
are decoupled from each other. 
Communications in one cannot affect another. Also, one communicator may 
be destroyed without affecting the other. 
.PP
.SH Return Value

.PP
An \fBIceTCommunicator\fP
with the same process group and rank as 
\fImpi_comm\fP\&.
The communicator may be destroyed with a call to 
\fBicetDestroyMPICommunicator\fP\&.
