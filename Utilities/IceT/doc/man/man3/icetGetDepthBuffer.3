.SH Description

.PP
Returns a buffer containing the result of the image composition performed 
by the last call to \fBicetDrawFrame\fP\&.
Be aware that a color or 
depth buffer may not have been computed with the last call to 
\fBicetDrawFrame\fP\&.
\fBIceT \fPavoids the computation and network 
transfers for any unnecessary buffers unless specifically requested 
otherwise with the flags given to the \fBicetInputOutputBuffers\fP
function. Use a call to \fBicetGetBooleanv\fPwith a value of 
\fBICET_COLOR_BUFFER_VALID\fP
or \fBICET_DEPTH_BUFFER_VALID\fP
to determine whether either of these buffers are available. Attempting 
to get a nonexistent buffer will result with a warning being emitted and 
NULL
returned. 
.PP
.SH Return Value

.PP
\fBicetGetColorBuffer\fPreturns the color buffer for the displayed tile. 
Each pixel value can be assumed to be four consecutive bytes in the 
buffer. The pixels are also always aligned on 4\-byte boundaries. The 
format of the color buffer is defined by the state parameter 
\fBICET_COLOR_FORMAT\fP,
which is typically either \fBGL_RGBA\fP,
\fBGL_BGRA\fP,
or \fBGL_BGRA_EXT\fP\&.
.PP
\fBicetGetDepthBuffer\fPreturns the depth buffer for the displayed tile. 
Depth values are stored as 32\-bit integers. 
.PP
The width and the height of the buffer are determined by the width and 
the height of the displayed tile at the time \fBicetDrawFrame\fP
was 
called. If the tile layout is changed since the last call to 
\fBicetDrawFrame\fP,
the dimensions of the buffer returned may not 
agree with the dimensions stored in the current \fBIceT \fPstate. 
.PP
The memory returned by \fBicetGetColorBuffer\fPand \fBicetGetDepthBuffer\fPneed 
not, and should not, be freed. It will be reclaimed in the next call to 
\fBicetDrawFrame\fP\&.
Expect the data returned to be obliterated on the 
next call to \fBicetDrawFrame\fP\&.
.PP
.SH Errors

.PP
None. 
.PP
.SH Warnings

.PP
.TP
\fBICET_INVALID_VALUE\fP
 The appropriate buffer is not 
available, either because it was not computed or it has been 
obliterated by a subsequent \fBIceT \fPcomputation. 
.PP
.SH Bugs

.PP
The returned image may have a value of $(R, G, B, A) = (0, 0, 0, 0)$ for 
a pixel instead of the true background color. This can usually be 
corrected by replacing all pixels with an alpha value of 0 with the 
background color. 
.PP
The buffers are stored in a shared memory pool attached to a particular 
context. As such, the buffers are not copied with the state. Also, 
because they are shared, it is conceivable that the buffers will be 
reclaimed before the next call to \fBicetDrawFrame\fP\&.
If this should 
happen, the \fBICET_COLOR_BUFFER_VALID\fP
and 
\fBICET_DEPTH_BUFFER_VALID\fP
state variables will be set 
accordingly.
