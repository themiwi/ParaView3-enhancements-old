.SH Description

.PP
The \fBicetSetContext\fP
function sets the \fBIceT \fPstate machine to work 
with the context defined by \fIcontext\fP
and the state associated with 
it. Further calls to \fBIceT \fPfunctions will operate based on the state 
encapsulated in \fIcontext\fP\&.
Changing the state of the context is a 
fast operation.

.SH Notes

.PP
The behavior of \fBicetSetContext\fP
is somewhat indeterminate if 
\fIcontext\fP
is not valid. Usually, an 
\fBICET_INVALID_VALUE\fP
error will be raised, but it is 
possible that the context will be set to some other context. Under any 
circumstances, a valid context will be current when this function 
returns.
