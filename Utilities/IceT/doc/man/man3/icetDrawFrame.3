.SH Description

.PP
Initiates a frame draw using the current \fbOpenGL \fPtransformation matrices 
(modelview and projection). 
.PP
\fBIceT \fPmay render an image, the tile display needs to be defined (using 
\fBicetAddTile\fP)
and the drawing function needs to be set (using 
\fBicetDrawFunc\fP).
The composite strategy may also optionally be set 
(using \fBicetStrategy\fP).
.PP
If \fBICET_DISPLAY\fP
is enabled, then the fully composited image is 
written back to the \fbOpenGL \fPframebuffer for display. It is the 
application\&'s responsibility to synchronize the processes and swap front 
and back buffers. If the \fbOpenGL \fPbackground color is set to something 
other than black, \fBICET_DISPLAY_COLORED_BACKGROUND\fP
should also 
be enabled. Displaying with \fBICET_DISPLAY_COLORED_BACKGROUND\fP
disabled may be slightly faster (depending on graphics hardware) but can 
result in black rectangles in the background. If 
\fBICET_DISPLAY_INFLATE\fP
is enabled and the size of the renderable 
window (determined by the current \fbOpenGL \fPviewport) is greater than that 
of the tile being displayed, then the image will first be `inflated\&' to 
the size of the actual display. If \fBICET_DISPLAY_INFLATE\fP
is 
disabled, the image is drawn at its original resolution at the lower left 
corner of the display. 
.PP
The image remaining in the frame buffer is undefined if 
\fBICET_DISPLAY\fP
is disabled or the process is not displaying a 
tile. 
.PP
.SH Errors

.PP
.TP
\fBICET_INVALID_OPERATION\fP
 Raised if the drawing function has not been set. Also can be raised if 
\fBicetDrawFrame\fP
is called recursively, probably from within the 
drawing callback. 
.TP
\fBICET_OUT_OF_MEMORY\fP
 Not enough memory left to hold intermittent frame buffers and other 
temporary data. 
.PP
.SH Warnings

.PP
None. 
.PP
.SH Bugs

.PP
If compositing with color blending on, the image returned with 
\fBicetGetColorBuffer\fPmay have values of $<R, G, B, A >= 
<0, 0, 0, 0 >$and the rest of the image may be blended with 
black rather than the correct background color. 
.PP
During compositing, image compression is employed that relies on knowing 
the maximum possible value in the z\-buffer. Unfortunately, different 
rendering hardware can give different results for this value. \fBIceT \fP
tries to dermine this value up front by clearing the screen and reading 
the z\-buffer value, but this test sometimes fails, resulting in a 
classification of background. The side effects of this are minimal, and 
\fBIceT \fPusually quickly fixes the problem by continually checking depth 
values.
