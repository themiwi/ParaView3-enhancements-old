.TH icetDestroyContext 3 "May 15, 2003" "Sandia National Labs" "ICE-T Reference"
.SH NAME
.B icetDestroyContext
\- delete a context
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <GL/ice-t.h>
.sp
.BI "void icetDeleteContext(IceTContext " context ");"
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
Frees the memory required to hold the state of
.I context
and removes
.I context
from existence.
.SH ERRORS
None.
.SH WARNINGS
None.
.SH BUGS
.B icetDestroyContext
will happily delete the current context for you, but subsequent calls to
most other
.B ICE-T
functions will probably result in seg-faults unless you make another
context current with
.BR icetCreateContext " or " icetSetContext .
The most notable execptions are the
.B icet*Context
functions themselves, which will work correctly without a proper current
context.
.SH NOTES
Behavior is undefined if
.I context
has never been created or has already been destroyed.
