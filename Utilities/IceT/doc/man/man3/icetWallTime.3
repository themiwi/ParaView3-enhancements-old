.SH Description

.PP
Retrieves the current time, in seconds. The returned values of 
\fBicetWallTime\fP
are only valid in relation to each other. That is, 
the time may or may not have anything to do with the current date or 
time. However, the difference of values between two calls to 
\fBicetWallTime\fP
is the elapsed time in seconds between the two 
calls. Thus, \fBicetWallTime\fP
is handy for determining the running 
time of various subprocesses. \fBicetWallTime\fP
is used internally 
for determining the values for the state variables 
\fBICET_BUFFER_READ_TIME\fP,
\fBICET_BUFFER_WRITE_TIME\fP,
\fBICET_COMPARE_TIME\fP,
\fBICET_COMPOSITE_TIME\fP,
\fBICET_COMPRESS_TIME\fP,
\fBICET_RENDER_TIME\fP,
and 
\fBICET_TOTAL_DRAW_TIME\fP\&.
