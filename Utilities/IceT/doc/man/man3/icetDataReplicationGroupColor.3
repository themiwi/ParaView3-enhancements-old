.SH Description

.PP
\fBIceT \fPhas the ability to take advantage of geometric data that is 
replicated among processes. If a group of processes share the same 
geometry data, then \fBIceT \fPwill split the region of the display that the 
data projects onto among the processes, thereby reducing the total amount 
of image composition work that needs to be done. 
.PP
Despite the name of the function, \fBicetDataReplicationGroupColor\fP
has nothing to do the color of the data being replicated. Instead, 
\fIcolor\fP
is used to mark the local process as part of a given group. 
When \fBicetDataReplicationGroupColor\fP
is called, it finds all other 
processes that have the same color and builds a group based on this 
information. 
.PP
\fBicetDataReplicationGroupColor\fP
must be called on every processes 
before the function will return.

.SH Bugs

.PP
\fBIceT \fPassumes that \fBicetDataReplicationGroup\fP
is called with the 
exact same parameters on all processes belonging to a given group. 
Likewise, \fBIceT \fPalso assumes that all processes have called 
\fBicetBoundingVertices\fP
or \fBicetBoundingBox\fP
with the exact 
same parameters on all processes belonging to a given group. These 
requirements are not strictly enforced, but failing to do so may cause 
some of the geometry to not be rendered.
