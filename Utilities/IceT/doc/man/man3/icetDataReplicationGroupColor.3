.SH NAME
.B icetDataReplicationGroupColor
\- define data replication.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <GL/ice-t.h>
.sp
.BI "void icetDataReplicationGroupColor(GLint " color ");"
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B ICE-T
has the ability to take advantage of geometric data that is replicated
among processes.  If a group of processes share the same geometry data,
then
.B ICE-T
will split the region of the display that the data projects onto among
the processes, thereby reducing the total amount of image composition work
that needs to be done.
.PP
Despite the name of the function,
.B icetDataReplicationGroupColor
has nothing to do the color of the data being replicated.  Instead,
.I color
is used to mark the local process as part of a given group.  When
.B icetDataReplicationGroupColor
is called, it finds all other processes that have the same color and builds
a group based on this information.
.PP
.B icetDataReplicationGroupColor
must be called on every processes before the function will return.
.SH ERRORS
None.
.SH WARNINGS
None.
.SH BUGS
.B ICE-T
assumes that all processes have called
.BR icetBoundingVertices " or " icetBoundingBox*
with the exact same parameters on all processes belonging to a given group.
This requirement is not strictly enforced, but failing to do so may cause
some of the geometry to not be rendered.
