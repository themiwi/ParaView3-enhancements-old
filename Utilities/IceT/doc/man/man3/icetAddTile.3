.SH Description

.PP
Adds a tile to the tiled display. Every process, whether actually 
displaying a tile or not, must declare the tiles in the display and which 
processes drive them with \fBicetResetTiles\fP
and \fBicetAddTile\fP\&.
Thus, each process calls \fBicetAddTile\fP
once for each tile in the 
display, and all processes must declare them in the same order. 
.PP
The parameters \fIx\fP,
\fIy\fP,
\fIwidth\fP,
and \fIheight\fP
define 
the tiles viewport in the logical global display much in the same way 
\fBglViewport\fP
declares a region in a physical display. 
\fBIceT \fPplaces no limits on the extents of the logical global display. 
That is, there are no limits on the values of \fIx\fP
and \fIy\fP\&.
They can extend as far as they want in both the positive and negative 
directions. 
.PP
\fBIceT \fPwill project its images onto the region of the logical global 
display that just covers all of the tiles. Therefore, shifting all the 
tiles in the logical global display by the same amount will have no real 
overall effect. 
.PP
The \fIdisplay_rank\fP
parameter identifies the rank of the process 
that will be displaying the given tile. It is assumed that the output of 
the rendering window of the given process is projected onto the space in 
a tiled display given by \fIx\fP,
\fIy\fP,
\fIwidth\fP,
and 
\fIheight\fP\&.
Each tile must have a valid rank (between 0 and 
$\fBICET_NUM_PROCESSES\fP
\- 1$). Furthermore, no process may be 
displaying more than one tile. 
.PP
.SH Return Value

.PP
Returns the index of the tile created. 
.PP
.SH Errors

.PP
.TP
\fBICET_INVALID_VALUE\fP
 Raised if \fIdisplay_rank\fP
is not a valid process rank or 
\fIdisplay_rank\fP
is already assigned to another tile. If this 
error is raised, nothing is done and \-1 is returned. 
.PP
.SH Warnings

.PP
None. 
.PP
.SH Bugs

.PP
\fBicetAddTile\fP
will let you add tiles of different sizes, but the 
use of different sized tiles is not yet supported. The user should try 
to make sure that all tiles are of the same size. 
.PP
All processes must specify the same tiles in the same order. \fBIceT \fP
will assume this even though it is not explicitly detected or enforced.
