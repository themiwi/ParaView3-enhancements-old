.SH Description

.PP
\fBicetInputOutputBuffers\fP
sets what OpenGL frame buffers \fBIceT \fPreads 
and generates. During a call to \fBicetDrawFrame\fP,
\fBIceT \fPreads the 
input buffers directly from OpenGL after it performs a callback to the 
draw function (set by \fBicetDrawFunc\fP).
Output buffers are stored 
internally after the call to \fBicetDrawFrame\fP
finishes. The output 
buffers can be retrieved with calls to the \fBicetGetColorBuffer\fP
and 
\fBicetGetDepthBuffer\fP
functions. In addition, if the color buffer 
output is on and \fBICET_DISPLAY\fP
is enabled, the color buffer is 
also written back to the OpenGL frame buffer before \fBicetDrawFrame\fP
returns. 
.PP
Both \fIinputs\fP
and \fIoutputs\fP
are or\&'ed values of one or more 
of the following flags: 
.TP
\fBICET_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT\fP
 Reads/generates color data. 
Color data is stored in RGBA or BGRA format. Each channel is 8\-bits, 
resulting in a 32\-bit word when combined together. Each 32\-bit color 
value is always aligned on 32\-bit word boundaries for faster 
computation. 
.TP
\fBICET_DEPTH_BUFFER_BIT\fP
 Reads/generates depth data. 
Depth data is stored as 32\-bit unsigned integers. 
.PP
The current values of the input and output buffers are stored in the 
\fBICET_INPUT_BUFFERS\fP
and \fBICET_OUTPUT_BUFFERS\fP
state 
variables. By default, the \fBICET_INPUT_BUFFERS\fP
value is set to 
$(\fBICET_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT\fP
| \fBICET_DEPTH_BUFFER_BIT\fP)$,
and the \fBICET_OUTPUT_BUFFERS\fP
value is set to 
$\fBICET_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT\fP$.
.PP
The composition operator \fBIceT \fPuses is defined by the inputs. If the 
depth buffer is an input, then Z comparison is performed. If the depth 
buffer is not an input, alpha blending is performed. Note that in the 
latter case, order of composition may matter and therefore not all 
composition strategies will work. 
.PP
.SH Errors

.PP
.TP
\fBICET_INVALID_VALUE\fP
 An output was selected that is 
not also an input or no outputs were selected at all. 
.PP
.SH Warnings

.PP
None. 
.PP
.SH Bugs

.PP
Blending of colors cannot be used in conjunction with depth testing. 
Even with depth testing, the order of operation for color blending is 
important, so such a combination is not likely to be useful.
