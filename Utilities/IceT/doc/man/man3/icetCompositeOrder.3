.TH icetCompositeOrder 3 "July 15, 2003" "Sandia National Labs" "ICE-T Reference"
.SH NAME
.B icetCompositeOrder
\- specify the order in which images are composited
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <GL/ice-t.h>
.sp
.BI "void icetCompositeOrder(const GLint *" process_ranks ");"
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
If
.B ICET_ORDERED_COMPOSITE
is enabled and the current strategy supports ordered composition, then the
order which images are composited are specified with
.BR icetCompositeOrder .
If compositing is done with z-buffer comparisons (i.e. the depth buffer is
selected as an input with
.BR icetInputOutputBuffers ),
then the ordering does not matter, and
.B ICET_ORDERED_COMPOSITE
should probably be disabled.  However, if compositing is done with color
blending (i.e. the depth buffer is
.I not
selected as in input with
.BR icetInputOutputBuffers ),
then the order in which the images are composed can drastically change the
output.
.PP
For ordered image compositing to work, the geometric objects rendered by
processes must be arranged such that if the geometry of one process is ``in
front'' of the geometry of another process for any camera ray, that
ordering holds for all camera rays.  It is the application's responsibility
to ensure that such an ordering exists and to find that ordering.  The
easiest way to do this is to ensure that the geometry of each process falls
cleanly into regions of an octree, k-d tree, or similar structure.
.PP
Once the geometry order is determined for a particular rendering viewpoint,
it is given to
.B ICE-T
in the form of an array of ranks.  The parameter
.I process_ranks
should have exactly
.B ICET_NUM_PROCESSES
entries, each with a unique, valid process rank.  The first process should
have the geometry that is ``in front'' of all others, the next directly
behind that, and so on.  It should be noted that the application may
actually impose only a partial order on the geometry, but that can easily
be converted to the linear ordering requird by
.BR ICE-T .
.PP
When ordering is on, it is accepted that
.B icetCompositeOrder
will be called in between every frame since the order of the geometry may
change with the viewpoint.
.SH ERRORS
.TP 20
.B ICET_INVALID_VALUE
Not every entry in the parameter
.I process_ranks
was a unique, valid process rank.
.SH WARNINGS
None.
.SH BUGS
If an
.B ICET_INVALID_VALUE
error is raised, internal arrays pertaining to the ordering of images may
not be restored properly.  If such an error is raised, the functions should
be re-invoked with a valid ordering before preceding.  Unpredictable
results may occur otherwise.
