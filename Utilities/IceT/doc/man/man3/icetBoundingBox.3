.SH DESCRIPTION
Establishes the bounds of the geometry as contained in an axis-aligned box
with the given extents.
.PP
.IR icetBoundingBoxd " and " icetBoundingBoxf
are really just convience functions.  They create an array of the 8 corner
vertices and set the bounding vertices appropriately.  See
.B icetBoundingVertices
for more information.
.SH ERRORS
None.
.SH WARNINGS
None.
.SH BUGS
None known.
