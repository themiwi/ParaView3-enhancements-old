  <li><i>The ParaView Guide</i> is currently available for purchase. Inside you
  will find everything you need to get started using and extending ParaView.
  This text includes introductions to parallel visualization and rendering, 3D
  interactions, level of detail, and scripting. A series of step-by-step
  tutorials walk you through a variety of different visualization tasks and how
  to accomplish them. Each aspect of the user interface is discussed and how it
  relates to the visualization in progress. The ParaView server manager is
  introduced which allows you to create your own parallel visualization
  applications by directly driving the server manager. The XML formats for
  extending ParaView with your own algorithms and file readers are covered in
  detail. <br />

  It is available from <a href="http://kitware.com/products/paraview.html">Kitware's web
site</a> and from <a href="http://www.amazon.com">www.amazon.com</a>.</li>
