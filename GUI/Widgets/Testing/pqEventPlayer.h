/**
Manages playback of test-cases, demos, tutorials, etc.
pqEventPlayer converts high-level ParaQ events 
(button click, row selection, etc) into low-level Qt events 
that drive the user interface.
The high-level events created by pqEventTranslator are fed to 
pqEventPlayer::playEvent() one-by-one, which passes each event 
through a collection of pqWidgetEventPlayer objects.  
Once a pqWidgetEventPlayer accepts the event and updates Qt, 
playEvent() returns, ready for the next high-level event.

pqEventPlayerXML is an example of an object that can retrieve 
high-level events from a file, feeding them to pqEventPlayer.

For specialized Qt widgets it may be necessary to create "custom" 
pqWidgetEventPlayer derivatives, which can be added to pqEventPlayer 
using the addWidgetEventPlayer() method.  
pqWidgetEventPlayer objects are searched in order for 
event playback, so you can also use this mechanism to
"override" the builtin event players.
