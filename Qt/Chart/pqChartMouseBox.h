 *  \class pqChartMouseBox
 *  \brief
 *    The pqChartMouseBox class stores the data for a mouse zoom or
 *    selection box.
 * 
 *  To use the pqChartMouseBox, code needs to be added to several
 *  key methods. The drag box interaction starts in the mouse press
 *  event. The box grows or shrinks in the mouse move event. In the
 *  mouse release event, the box is finalized and used for its
 *  intent (zoom, select, etc.).
 * 
 *  In the mouse press event, the mouse location needs to be saved.
 *  The coordinate system used to determine the mouse location must
 *  be the same coordinate system used to set up the box.
 *  \code
 *  void SomeClass::mousePressEvent(QMouseEvent *e)
 *  {
 *     this->mouseBox->Last = e->pos();
 *  }
 *  \endcode
 * 
 *  In the mouse move event, the drag box needs to be updated. The
 *  point set in the mouse press event should remain unchanged until
 *  the mouse release event. If your class watches all mouse move
 *  events, make sure the box is only updated for drag events.
 *  \code
 *  void SomeClass::mouseMoveEvent(QMouseEvent *e)
 *  {
 *     QRect area = this->mouseBox->Box;
 *     this->mouseBox->adjustBox(e->pos());
 * 
 *     // Repaint the zoom box. Unite the previous area with the new
 *     // area to ensure all the changes get repainted.
 *     if(area.isValid())
 *        area = area.unite(this->mouseBox->Box);
 *     else
 *        area = this->mouseBox->Box;
 *     update(area);
 *  }
 *  \endcode
 * 
 *  In the mouse release event, the drag box needs to be updated
 *  with the release location before using it. After using the box,
 *  it should be reset for the next time.
 *  \code
 *  void SomeClass::mouseReleaseEvent(QMouseEvent *e)
 *  {
 *     this->mouseBox->adjustBox(e->pos());
 *     QRect area = this->mouseBox->Box;
 *     ...
 *     this->mouseBox->resetBox();
 *     update(area);
 *  }
 *  \endcode
 * 
 *  The paint event should also be modified to display the drag box.
 *  Only the rectangle is stored in the pqChartMouseBox, so you can
 *  display the box any way you like. The following code draws a
 *  dashed line around the box.
 *  \code
 *  void SomeClass::paintEvent(QPaintEvent *e)
 *  {
 *     ...
 *     if(this->mouseBox->Box.isValid())
 *     {
 *        painter->setPen(Qt::black);
 *        painter->setPen(Qt::DotLine);
 *        painter->drawRect(this->data->Box.x(), this->data->Box.y(),
 *           this->data->Box.width() - 1, this->data->Box.height() - 1);
 *     }
 *     ...
 *  }
 *  \endcode
