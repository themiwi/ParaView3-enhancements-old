/// \brief
///   The pqLineChartPlot class is the base class for all line chart
///   plots.
///
/// The pqLineChartModel class uses the %pqLineChartPlot interface to
/// define the individual line plots in the model. This class should
/// be extended to create a line plot for the line chart model.
///
/// The line chart plot is composed of one or more point series. Each
/// point series is painted in the order it is stored. Meaning, the
/// first series is painted first, and the last series is painted
/// last. Each series has a type associated with it so the chart can
/// determine how to draw it.
///
/// To create a scatter plot, the plot would only need one series of
/// points. To create a line plot, the plot would need two series.
/// One for the line and one for the points. The points should be
/// after the line in order to be drawn on top of the line. An error
/// plot would need three series: one for the error bounds, one for
/// the line, and one for the points.

  ///   \li Call \c beginMultiSeriesChange.
  ///   \li Call begin insert/remove for each affected series.
  ///   \li Make the change to the underlying data.
  ///   \li Call end insert/remove for each affected series.
  ///   \li Call \c endMultiSeriesChange.
  ///
  /// An examle of this is a line plot that draws a point on every
  /// line segment intersection. The line plot uses one list to store
  /// the points for a \c Line series and a \c Point series. In order
  /// to add or remove points, the multi-series change mechanism would
  /// have to be used.
