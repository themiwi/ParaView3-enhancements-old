///   The pqLookmarkBrowser class displays the list of lookmarks (their names and icons)

/// It provides an interface for loading and removing lookmarks.

/// Still to do: 
///  - hook up importing and exporting lookmarks
///  - convert to a tree view
///  - should we allow user to create a lookmark from the browser?
