/// pqSignalAdaptorSelectionTreeWidget has two roles.
/// \li It can be used to connect a vtkSMStringVectorProperty with a
/// QTreeWidget (typically pqSelectionTreeWidget) where the SMProperty
/// must have the values of only the selected items in the tree widget.
/// Alternatively, it can be used to connect a vtkSMIntVectorProperty
/// having a vtkSMEnumerationDomain with a QTreeWidget 
/// (typically pqSelectionTreeWidget). Here too the vtkSMIntVectorProperty
/// is an expandable property which is filled with values for all
/// the selected items.
/// \li Since the SMProperty contanis only the selected item, this adaptor
/// requires a vtkSMStringListDomain (or vtkSMEnumerationDomain) from which 
/// it can get the list of possible values. 
/// It also updates the list of available values every time
/// the domain changes.
/// Example use of this adaptor is to connect :
/// \li "AddVolumeArrayName" property of a CTHPart filter to a 
///     pqSelectionTreeWidget widget.
/// \li "Functions" property of "P3DReader" with a pqSelectionTreeWidget.
