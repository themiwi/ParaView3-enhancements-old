/*! \class pqLookmarkDefinitionWizard
 *  \brief
 *    The pqLookmarkDefinitionWizard class is used to create a
 *    lookmark definition.
 *
 *  Currently the user only needs to provide a name for the lookmark. But in the future, other 
 *  lookmark metadata could be given such as a description of the lookmark
 * 
 *  Currently a lookmark needs three things to be created: a unique name, an icon (of the current view), and an XML representation of a subset of the server manager state. 
 *
 *  But which subset of the server manager state is saved? The current implementation saves:
 *   - all pqConsumerDisplays that are visible in the given pqRenderViewModule
 *   - all pqConsumerDisplays that are invisible in the given pqRenderViewModule but "upstream" from a visible one in the pipeline 
 *   - all pqPipelineSources associated with the displays being saved
 *   - all referred proxies of all saved display and source proxies. A referred proxy is one that is part of a proxy property of a saved proxy.
 *   - the vtkSMRenderModuleProxy state (but not its referred proxies)
 *
