// .NAME vtkReferenceCountedVector - a dynamic vector with reference counting
//
// .SECTION Description
// This is a vector class with reference counting. It makes some
// assumptions about the type it is storing. Each element is a pointer 
// to a type that has methods Register(void*) and Unregister(void*).

   // Description:
  // Remove an Item from the vector

  // Description:
  // Removes all items from the container.

  // Description:
  // Since we know that the storage type is a pointer, we can use
  // this knowledge to have easier acces for its members. This
  // method returns either NULL or the object.
